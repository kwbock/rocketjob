    # Automatically starts a new instance of this job anytime it fails, aborts, or completes.
    #
    # Notes:
    # * Restartable jobs automatically abort if they fail. This prevents the failed job from being retried.
    #   - To disable this behavior, add the following empty method:
    #        def rocket_job_restart_abort
    #        end
    # * On destroy this job is destroyed without starting a new instance.
    # * On Abort a new instance is created.
    # * Include `RocketJob::Plugins::Singleton` to prevent multiple copies of a job from running at
    #   the same time.
    # * The job will not be restarted if:
    #   - A validation fails after creating the new instance of this job.
    #   - The job has expired.
    # * Only the fields that have `copy_on_restart: true` will be passed onto the new instance of this job.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # class RestartableJob < RocketJob::Job
    #   include RocketJob::Plugins::Restart
    #
    #   # Retain the completed job under the completed tab in Rocket Job Web Interface.
    #   self.destroy_on_complete = false
    #
    #   # Will be copied to the new job on restart.
    #   field :limit, type: Integer, copy_on_restart: true
    #
    #   # Will _not_ be copied to the new job on restart.
    #   field :list, type: Array, default: [1,2,3]
    #
    #   # Set run_at every time a new instance of the job is created.
    #   after_initialize set_run_at, if: :new_record?
    #
    #   def perform
