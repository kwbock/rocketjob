      # Throttle the number of jobs of a specific class that are processed at the same time.

      # Example:
      #   class MyJob < RocketJob::Job
      #     # Maximum number of jobs of this class to process at the same time.
      #     self.throttle_running_jobs = 25

      #
      # Notes:
      # - The number of running jobs will not exceed this value.
      # - It may appear that a job is running briefly over this limit, but then is immediately back into queued state.
      #   This is expected behavior and is part of the check to ensure this value is not exceeded.
      #   The worker grabs the job and only then verifies the throttle, this is to prevent any other worker
      #   from attempting to grab the job, which would have exceeded the throttle.
