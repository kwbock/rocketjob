## Rocket Job v5

- Support for Ruby v3 and Rails 6.
- Multiple output file support through extended `output_categories` capability.
    - File output formats for each category. For example: CSV, PSV, JSON, etc.
- Support for AWS DocumentDB as the data store.
- Removed use of Symbols to meet Symbol deprecation in MongoDB and Mongoid.

The following plugins have been deprecated and will be removed in Rocket Job v5.1
- RocketJob::Batch::Tabular::Input
- RocketJob::Batch::Tabular::Output

## Rocket Job v4

Rocket Job Pro is now open source and included in Rocket Job. 

The `RocketJob::Batch` plugin now adds batch processing capabilities to break up a single task into many
concurrent workers processing slices of the entire job at the same time. 


Example:

```ruby
class MyJob < RocketJob::Job
  include RocketJob::Batch
  
  self.description         = "Reverse names"
  self.destroy_on_complete = false
  
  # Collect the output for this job in the default output category: `:main`
  output_category

  # Method to call by all available workers at the same time.
  # Reverse the characters for each line: 
  def perform(line)
    line.reverse
  end
end
```

Upload a file for processing, for example `names.csv` which could contain:

```
jack
jane
bill
john
blake
chris
dave
marc
```

To queue the above job for processing:

```ruby
job = MyJob.new
job.upload('names.csv')
job.save!
```

Once the job has completed, download the results into a file:

```ruby
job.download('names_reversed.csv')
```

## Upgrading to V3

V3 replaces MongoMapper with Mongoid which supports the latest MongoDB Ruby client driver.

### Upgrading Mongo Config file
Replace `mongo.yml` with `mongoid.yml`.

Start with the sample [mongoid.yml](https://github.com/rocketjob/rocketjob/blob/feature/mongoid/test/config/mongoid.yml).
 
For more information on the new [Mongoid config file](https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/master/tutorials/5.1.0/mongoid-installation/).

Note: The `rocketjob` and `rocketjob_slices` clients in the above `mongoid.yml` file are required.

### Other changes

* Arguments are no longer supported, use fields for defining all named arguments for a job.

* Replace usages of `rocket_job do` to set default values:

~~~ruby
  rocket_job do |job|
    job.priority = 25
  end
~~~

With:

~~~ruby
  self.priority = 25
~~~

* Replace `key` with `field` when adding attributes to a job:

~~~ruby
  key :inquiry_defaults, Hash
~~~

With:

~~~ruby
  field :inquiry_defaults, type: Hash, default: {}
~~~

* Replace usage of `public_rocket_job_properties` with the `user_editable` option:

~~~ruby
field :priority, type: Integer, default: 50, user_editable: true
~~~
